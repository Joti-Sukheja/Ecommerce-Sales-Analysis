# Ecommerce Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed analysis of eCommerce sales data using SQL and Python. The analysis includes data processing, querying, and visualization to derive valuable insights from an eCommerce dataset. The dataset covers various aspects of customer orders, sales, products, payments, and delivery, and the analysis aims to answer key business questions at different levels of complexity.

## Project Description

This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of eCommerce sales using SQL queries and Python for data processing and visualization. The dataset used contains multiple CSV files, including customer information, orders, sales, products, delivery, and payment data. 

The project includes the following components:
- **Data Ingestion**: The `csv_to_sql.py` script imports data from CSV files into a MySQL database.
- **SQL Analysis**: SQL queries are used to answer various business questions, from basic queries to advanced ones.
- **Python Analysis**: Python is used for data visualization, analysis, and additional processing in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Key Features

- **Data Processing**: Data is cleaned and structured before analysis, including handling missing values and data type conversions.
- **SQL Queries**: A series of SQL queries are executed to answer business questions about customer orders, sales, and more.
- **Visualizations**: Data visualizations are generated to help interpret the results and provide actionable insights.

## Analysis Questions

The following are the types of questions analyzed in this project:

### Basic Queries
1. List all unique cities where customers are located.
2. Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
3. Find the total sales per category.
4. Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
5. Count the number of customers from each state.

### Intermediate Queries
1. Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
2. Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
3. Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
4. Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
5. Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.

### Advanced Queries
1. Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
2. Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.
3. Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
4. Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
5. Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.
